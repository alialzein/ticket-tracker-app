## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Dropdown Doesn't Appear

**Problem:** Typing `@` doesn't show autocomplete

**Solutions:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify `appState.allUsers` has data: `console.log(appState.allUsers)`
3. Make sure you're typing in a note editor (not subject field)
4. Check that Quill editor initialized: `console.log(quillInstances)`

### Notifications Don't Appear

**Problem:** Mentioned users don't get notified

**Solutions:**
1. **Run the SQL script first!** (mention_notifications_table.sql)
2. **Enable Realtime in Supabase** for `mention_notifications` table
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify `#notification-panel` exists in HTML
5. Check Supabase logs for permission errors

### Navigation Doesn't Work

**Problem:** Clicking notification doesn't navigate

**Solutions:**
1. Check `window.ui.switchView` function exists
2. Check ticket exists in database
3. Look for errors in browser console
4. Verify user has permission to view the ticket

### Mentions Not Detected

**Problem:** @username typed but not saved as mention

**Solutions:**
1. Check `appState.allUsers` contains the username
2. Username must match exactly (case-sensitive)
3. Look at note's `mentioned_user_ids` field in database
4. Check regex pattern in `addNote()` function
